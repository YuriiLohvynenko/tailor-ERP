## Configuration

1. **Configure the environment file:**
   Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env:
   ```bash

2. **Apache/Nginx Configuration:**
   Ensure your Apache or Nginx is pointing to the public directory of the project.

   Example for Apache (in your VirtualHost):
   ```bash
   DocumentRoot "/path/to/tailor-erp/public"
   <Directory "/path/to/tailor-erp/public">
       AllowOverride All
   </Directory>

1. Create a new database:
   ```bash
   CREATE DATABASE erp_db;

2. Import the database schema from the database/erp_db.sql file:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p erp_db < database/erp_db.sql
